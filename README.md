## Features

- A self playing mode, where you guess the word yourself.

- A training mode, where the AI learns what the best starting word is.

# Afterword

This project was made as a fun experience to see how easy it is to remake Wordle as a simple CLI game and how we can make a really simple AI to play it.
It also served as a refresher to my python knowledge even though it is a relatively simple project. If you would like to improve the AI or add more features, feel free to fork the repository and make a pull request.
